## Food Truck Ratings Project

### Week 2 Project at Skill Distillery

### Overview:

#### This program is designed to process user input data about Food Trucks. The application can accommodate as many Food Trucks as the user would like to enter. Once the data is entered, the user can then select from a menu of options as to how that data can be processed and displayed.  

### How to run:

#### First, the user enters how many food trucks they would like to enter. For each food truck, the user will be asked to enter the truck's name, type of food they serve, and the rating they would like to give the truck.  

#### Next, the user will be asked to enter another truck's information, or they can change their decision regarding how many they would like to enter by typing quit.

#### After the last truck has been entered or quit was entered, the program will give the user three options from a menu of features. They can request to see a list all the trucks, see the average rating of the trucks, see what truck is the highest rated, or exit the program.  

### Technologies used:

#### Java, Eclipse, Atom, Git, and Github.  

### Topics implemented:

#### Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Encapsulation, Object initiation, packages, StringBuilder, toString(), this, this(), and Eclipse shortcuts.
#### Java Fundamentals of Programming: Arrays, iteration, for loops, while loops, and a switch statement.

### Lessons learned:

#### I learned how to effectively handle a null pointer errors Java. This error was my friend in helping me to see that I had null data inside my arrays because of errors. These errors helped me make this program work, and I am thankful that Eclipse displayed this error to me.    

#### Additionally, I discovered many new methods like Arrays.copyOf() which was used in the FoodTruckApp (line 43). This method copies the specified array, truncating or padding with zeros (if necessary) so the copy has the specified length (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html).

#### I think the biggest thing I learned this week was Object-Oriented Programming in Java. I used this knowledge to create an Object, Implement the toString() method in my classes to represent object state, understand object references and the heap, and use constructors to give data to object fields.
